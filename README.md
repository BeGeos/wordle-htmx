## Wordle Clone HTMX

That's the name of the game

1. Green cells means the letter is correct and in the correct position
2. Yellow cells means the letter is correct but in the wrong location
3. Grey cells are just wrong

You win if you guess the word correctly. From [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) by the New Yor Times

### Note

This project has a fundamental flaw. Can you guess it?
